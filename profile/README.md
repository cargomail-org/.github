Cargomail focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce an authentication mechanism through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/cargomail/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This mechanism is beneficial in the email system to protect MTA-to-MTA communication.

As a proof of concept, we developed [Cargomail](https://github.com/cargomail/cargomail) â€” a revised email system. This email system uses an [Intermodal Message Transfer Agent (iMTA)](https://github.com/cargomail/imta) to transfer arbitrary messages from one computer to another.
