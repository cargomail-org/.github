The email system, while conceptually sound as a communication means, is structurally obsolete and functionally deficient. Given that, we introduce [Cargomail](https://github.com/cargomail-org/cargomail) â€” a revised email system.

Cargomail uses an [Intermodal Message Transfer Agent (IMTA)](https://github.com/cargomail-org/imta) to transfer email resources using push and pull modes. These modes help to overcome the email system's data storage and transmission limitations.

After all, we introduce an authentication mechanism through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/cargomail-org/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This mechanism is beneficial in the email system to protect IMTA-to-IMTA communication.
